Do Nothing:
첫번째 방법, 아무것도 하지 마라. 알고리즘이 알아서 결측값을 핸들링하게 두면 된다. 일부 알고리즘들은 결측값을 파악하여, 손실함수 값을 기준으로 결측값을 어떻게 채우는 것이 가장 나은 성능을 갖는지 학습한다(ex. XGBoost). 또 어떤 알고리즘들은 그냥 결측값을 무시해 버린다(ex. LightGBM - use_missing=False).

To win in the marketplace, you must first win in the workplace. ~ Doug Conant

And rightly so! Happy and healthy employees are indisputably more productive at work, and in turn, help the business flourish profoundly.

1. Introduction

Dataset : 
Employee ID: The unique ID allocated for each employee (example: fffe390032003000)
Date of Joining: The date-time when the employee has joined the organization (example: 2008-12-30)
Gender: The gender of the employee (Male/Female)
Company Type: The type of company where the employee is working (Service/Product)
WFH Setup Available: Is the work from home facility available for the employee (Yes/No)
Designation: The designation of the employee of work in the organization.
In the range of [0.0, 5.0] bigger is higher designation.
Resource Allocation: The amount of resource allocated to the employee to work, ie. number of working hours.
In the range of [1.0, 10.0] (higher means more resource)
Mental Fatigue Score: The level of fatigue mentally the employee is facing.
In the range of [0.0, 10.0] where 0.0 means no fatigue and 10.0 means completely fatigue.
Burn Rate: The value we need to predict for each employee telling the rate of Bur out while working.
In the range of [0.0, 1.0] where the higher the value is more is the burn out.
